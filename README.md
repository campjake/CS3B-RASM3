### Summary of Requirements for Driver Function
- [ ] Determines the length of the first string and print the length
- [ ] Determines if str1 and str2 are equal and print the result of the comparison
- [ ] Determines if str3 and str4 are equal and print the result of the comparison
- [ ] Determines if str3 and str4 are equal, ignoring letter case, and print the result of the comparison
- [ ] Creates a copy of str1 as str5
- [ ] Creates a substring of str1 as str6, which ends in position 1 and ends in position 5, and print it
- [ ] Uses str6 to contain the address of a substring of str1 that begins JUST in position one and print it
- [ ] Gets input from the user, iPosition
- [ ] Prints the single character at position 3 in str1
- [ ] Gets input strTest and converts iPosition from an ascii/asciz value to 64-bit integer
- [ ] Determines if str1 starts with strTest starting in iPosition and print the result of the comparison
- [ ] Print both a true and false return from the comparison from the previous step (use the same ascii and change iPosition)
- [ ] Gets strTest again
- [ ] Determines if str1 starts with strTest and print the result of the comparison
- [ ] Gets strTest again
- [ ] Determines if str1 ends with strTest and print the result of the comparison
